Credit Scoring Analysis
Overview

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of credit scoring patterns using data science techniques. The objective was to gain insights into the factors influencing credit scores, segment individuals based on their creditworthiness, and calculate credit scores based on a weighted combination of relevant attributes.
Project Highlights

    Data Exploration: Meticulously explored the dataset, examining its structure and summary statistics to understand underlying patterns.

    Visualization: Utilized matplotlib and seaborn libraries to create insightful visualizations such as box plots, histograms, and heatmaps to uncover relationships between various features and their impact on credit scoring.

    Feature Engineering: Engineered features by assigning weights to selected attributes based on their importance in determining credit scores. Categorical features were mapped to numerical values for inclusion in the credit score calculation.

    Credit Score Calculation: Computed credit scores for individuals by applying a weighted sum of selected features, including payment history, credit utilization ratio, number of credit accounts, education level, and employment status.

    Cluster Analysis: Employed KMeans clustering to segment individuals into distinct clusters based on their computed credit scores, facilitating identification of different creditworthiness categories from 'Very Low' to 'Excellent'.

    Insights & Recommendations: Extracted valuable insights into credit scoring patterns, informing decision-making processes for lenders and financial institutions.

Outcome

By combining data exploration, feature engineering, credit score calculation, and cluster analysis techniques, intricate patterns within the credit scoring data were unveiled. The project not only provided valuable insights into creditworthiness determinants but also demonstrated proficiency in data science methodologies and techniques.
